/*

Example 1:
Input: words = ["bab","dab","cab"], groups = [1,2,2]
Output: ["bab","cab"]
Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is [0,2].
groups[0] != groups[2]
words[0].length == words[2].length, and the hamming distance between them is 1.
So, a valid answer is [words[0],words[2]] = ["bab","cab"].
Another subsequence that can be selected is [0,1].
groups[0] != groups[1]
words[0].length == words[1].length, and the hamming distance between them is 1.
So, another valid answer is [words[0],words[1]] = ["bab","dab"].
It can be shown that the length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the conditions is 2.

Example 2:
Input: words = ["a","b","c","d"], groups = [1,2,3,4]
Output: ["a","b","c","d"]
Explanation: We can select the subsequence [0,1,2,3].
It satisfies both conditions.
Hence, the answer is [words[0],words[1],words[2],words[3]] = ["a","b","c","d"].
It has the longest length among all subsequences of indices that satisfy the conditions.
Hence, it is the only answer.
