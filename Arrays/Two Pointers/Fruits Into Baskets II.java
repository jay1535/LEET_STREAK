/*

Example 1:

Input: fruits = [4,2,5], baskets = [3,5,4]

Output: 1

Explanation:

fruits[0] = 4 is placed in baskets[1] = 5.
fruits[1] = 2 is placed in baskets[0] = 3.
fruits[2] = 5 cannot be placed in baskets[2] = 4.
Since one fruit type remains unplaced, we return 1.

Example 2:

Input: fruits = [3,6,1], baskets = [6,4,7]

Output: 0

Explanation:

fruits[0] = 3 is placed in baskets[0] = 6.
fruits[1] = 6 cannot be placed in baskets[1] = 4 (insufficient capacity) but can be placed in the next available basket, baskets[2] = 7.
fruits[2] = 1 is placed in baskets[1] = 4.
Since all fruits are successfully placed, we return 0.
